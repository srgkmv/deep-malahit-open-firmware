# Porting this firmware to the Malahit DSP-1

Status: **bring-up, nothing builds for this board yet.** What exists so far is
the hardware reference (`BOARD.md`), a working debug path (`openocd.cfg`,
`tools/`) and this plan.

The upstream firmware targets the DEEPSDR 101 (GD32F450VET6, 800 × 480
parallel panel, QSD mixer, MS5351 LO, TLV320AIC3204 codec, external SPI NOR
flash). The Malahit DSP-1 is a different board with the same *shape* of
signal chain. See `BOARD.md` for what is actually on it.

---

## 1. Why this is worth trying

Both receivers digitise analog I/Q with an **audio codec at roughly 100–200
kHz**, not with a wideband ADC. That single fact is what makes the port
possible: the whole of `sdr_rx.c → iqbal → demod_am.c → <28 modes>` is the
same architecture on both radios. Roughly 90 % of `User/` — every
demodulator, FT8, HFDL, STANAG, WSPR, AIS, SSTV, WEFAX, RTTY, PSK31, the AGC,
the noise reduction, the filters — is portable C that never touches a
register. Only 31 of the 337 files in `User/` include `gd32f4xx.h` at all.

And the target is a big step up: Cortex-M7 at 480 MHz against M4F at 200 MHz,
2 MB flash against 512 kB, ~1 MB RAM against ~192 kB.

## 2. What has to be replaced

| Upstream file(s) | Lines | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| `ms5351.c`, `lo_gen_gd32.c` | 1577 | `msi001.c` — 3-wire control on PA4/PA5/PA7, 22 MHz reference, Mirics register map: LO PLL, band mode (AM1/AM2/VHF/B3/B4/B5/L), LNA/mixer/baseband gain, baseband filter width, DC offset |
| `rf_lpf.c` | 110 | `BPF1`…`BPF6` on PE10–PE15 plus `PREAMP` on PE0 |
| `aic3204.c` | 1143 | `nau8822.c` — SPI control, not I²C; different register map; built-in speaker amp |
| `gd32_i2s.c` | 1305 | SAI1 on the H743, **master** (the MCU drives MCLK from PE2), with DMA |
| `rm68120_exmc.c`, `lcd_dma.c` | 1401 | ILI9488 over SPI3 + DMA |
| `touch.c`, `touch_calib.c` | ~1000 | capacitive controller on I2C3; no calibration needed |
| `encoder.c` | 241 | two encoders plus buttons |
| `spi_flash.c` | 6088 | the W25Q driver and FAT32 layer are portable; only the SPI backend changes — **but the chip itself is absent on this board**, see §4 |
| `usb_cdc_hw.c`, `usb/GD32F4xx_usb_library/` | — | ST's OTG_FS driver or TinyUSB |
| `dfu_salto.c`, `cargador.c`, `boot/` | — | probably nothing: the H743 has a ROM DFU bootloader on BOOT0, which jumper JP1 already reaches. Dropping the custom bootloader removes the single riskiest subsystem of the port |
| `battery.c`, `rtc_hw.c`, `backlight.c`, `reset_causa.c` | ~935 | H7 ADC / RTC / timer PWM / RCC |

`ipa_blit.c` is a happy exception: the GD32's IPA is the same block as ST's
Chrom-ART, so it becomes DMA2D with little more than a rename.

## 3. The four real problems

### 3.1 The display, and the UI on top of it

800 × 480 → 480 × 320 is 3.4× fewer pixels. The upstream layout is not
parameterised, it is hand-fitted: `main.c` is 39 094 lines and carries
constants like `MAIN_W = 800`, `MENU_AREA_W(800)`, `RTTY_TEXT_COLS = 66`, with
comments doing arithmetic such as "8 buttons of 126 + 5 gaps of 8 + 2 = 800
exactly". This is a redesign of header, spectrum, waterfall, FT8 map, HFDL
list, menus and frequency keypad — not a change of `#define`.

It is also the largest single piece of work in the whole port, and the part
with the least leverage from the hardware being better.

**Mitigation: `deepsdr-ui/` already compiles the real firmware files on a PC
and emits PNGs** (290 test programs). The entire 480 × 320 relayout can be
done and reviewed on a desktop before any of it runs on the radio.

### 3.2 Sample rate

Upstream runs 48 / 96 / 192 kHz, and the SSB branch decimates by 4 to
**12 kHz**, which is what HFDL, STANAG, FT8 and the rest of the digital modes
expect at their input. The stock Malahit firmware runs 160 / 80 / 40 kHz;
dividing 160 by 4 gives 20 kHz and every digital mode lands on the wrong rate.

Two ways out:

1. Find out whether the NAU8822 will run at 192 kHz on *this* board. The
   often-quoted "PLL only locks between 90 and 100 MHz" constraint applies to
   the codec running as clock master; here the **MCU supplies MCLK = 256 × Fs**
   from PE2, so the codec's own PLL is out of the picture. If 192 kHz works,
   the entire DSP chain keeps its rates untouched.
2. Otherwise insert a rational resampler. `hfdl_rational_resampler.c` already
   exists and can be generalised.

Settle this early — it decides how much of §2 is a driver swap and how much is
a retune of every filter corner, decimation factor and time constant.

### 3.3 Storage

No SPI NOR flash, no SD card. 32 kB of FRAM, and that is all. Upstream keeps
maps, the station database, the aircraft database, screenshots, SSTV captures
and WEFAX images on a FAT32 disk in SPI NOR; `mapas/` alone is 11 MB.

For now: **build without the disk.** Settings go in the FRAM, which suits them
better than flash anyway. Maps, the station database and USB MSC are disabled.

Later: a W25Q128 fits on the existing SPI2 bus beside the FRAM, needing only a
second chip select from one of the free pins on header J6. Upstream already
sizes the chip at boot, so no recompile is needed once it is there.

### 3.4 The H7 itself

Things the M4 did not have and that will bite:

- **D-cache against DMA.** Every SAI, SPI and DMA2D buffer needs either an MPU
  region marked non-cacheable or explicit clean/invalidate. This is the
  classic "works, but occasionally garbage" failure.
- **HSE is 22 MHz in bypass mode** (`RCC_CR.HSEBYP`), shared with the tuner.
  No STM32H7 example anywhere assumes 22 MHz; every PLL divider has to be
  recomputed.
- Flash writes are 256 bits wide and sectors are 128 kB.
- Power supply configuration (LDO vs SMPS) must be set before raising the
  clock, or the chip hangs at `PWR_D3CR.VOSRDY`.

## 4. Order of work

Each step should end with something visible on the radio.

0. **Debug path.** Done — `tools/swd.sh id` answers.
1. **Blink.** Minimal H743 project: HSE bypass at 22 MHz, PLLs, `PC6` high for
   the peripheral rail, `PB8` for the backlight, UART7 on PE7/PE8 as console.
2. **Panel.** ILI9488 over SPI3. Measure the real throughput and settle the
   16-bit-versus-18-bit-per-pixel question.
3. **Touch.** Identify the controller on I2C3, read coordinates.
4. **Codec.** NAU8822 control over SPI, SAI1 master with MCLK = 256 × Fs,
   loopback a tone. Find the maximum stable Fs — this answers §3.2.
5. **Tuner.** MSi001 register sequence, tune, check I/Q quality and what
   `iqbal.c` makes of it.
6. **Spectrum.** First real milestone: FFT on screen, a signal visible.
7. **AM.** Audio out of the speaker.
8. **Graft the upstream DSP tree** mode by mode.
9. **Relayout the UI** at 480 × 320, in the simulator first.

Steps 1–7 are a new, small board-support tree. Only at step 8 does the bulk of
the upstream code arrive — which means a long stretch of visible progress
before the hard part, rather than months of nothing.

## 5. What the Malahit gains

- MSi001 reaches far beyond the DEEPSDR's 180 MHz ceiling (with a hardware
  gap at roughly 263–390 MHz that no firmware can close).
- Room for longer FFTs, a wider FT8 search window, more waterfall history.
- A second encoder.
- A capacitive touch panel instead of a resistive one.

## 6. Prior art

[Cerk-sdr](https://github.com/TheHuziek/Cerk-sdr) — an open firmware for this
same radio, written in Rust. Early (a handful of commits), but its TODO list
is exactly the three drivers in §2: ILI9488, MSi001, NAU8822. Worth reading
for register sequences even though this port is C.

## 7. Licence

Upstream is **AGPL-3.0**, and this port is a derivative work, so it stays
AGPL-3.0 and its source stays published. `../PROCEDENCIA.md` is upstream's
file-by-file inventory of third-party code (ft8_lib is MIT, the RM68120 panel
table comes from Espressif); anything this port adds should be recorded the
same way.
